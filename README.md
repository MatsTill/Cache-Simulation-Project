## Project Description & Specifications:
The Cache Simulation System implemented in this project is designed to emulate a Fully Associative (FA) cache with a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) replacement policy. The system provides a user-friendly GUI, ensuring a seamless experience for users. It is implemented in Python, utilizing the Tkinter library for the graphical interface.

The common specifications for the cache system are as follows:
Number of Cache Blocks: 32 blocks
Cache Line: 64 words
Read Policy: Load-Through
Number of Memory Blocks: User-input, allowing flexibility in the size of the simulated memory.

## Features Implemented
Memory Access Simulation: Users can choose from various test cases, including Sequential Sequences, Random Sequences, and Mid-Repeat Blocks Sequences.

FIFO Replacement Policy: The system employs the FIFO replacement policy to manage cache contents when a cache miss occurs.

GUI Visualization: The graphical interface provides a real-time representation of the cache memory, allowing users to observe cache hits, misses, and memory access traces.

## GUI Output
1. Cache Memory Snapshot: Users can choose between a step-by-step animated tracing option or a final memory snapshot. The system generates a visual representation of the cache memory, aiding in the understanding of cache dynamics.
2. Text Log: A detailed text log is provided, capturing the cache memory trace.
3. Performance Metrics: The system outputs key performance metrics, including memory access count, cache hit count, cache miss count, cache hit rate, cache miss rate, average memory access time, and total memory access time.
